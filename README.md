## Object-Oriented Programming

A **Class** is a **data type definition** composed of members:
+ Data members (fields / attributes)
+ Function members (methods)

An **Object** or **Instance** of a Class is a **piece of data**.

### Encapsulation
#### An object's methods act as an "interface" to the object's fields/attributes.
Only the class methods should interact the fields (the data) of the object. Thus, those methods "encapsulate" all the data/attributes in the class/objects.

### Inheritance
#### Allows new classes to reuse, extend, and modify the behavior of other classes.
Objects can take on properties of an existing object/class.

### Polymorphism
#### Accepts varied number and/or types of inputs.
Behavior can change based on the inputs.

### Abstraction
#### Arranges the complexity of a system.
Only relevant data is shown to the user and unnecessary details are hidden.
