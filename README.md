# Object-Oriented Programming

A **Class** a **data type definition** composed of members:
+ Data members (fields / attributes)
+ Function members (methods)

An **Object** or **Instance** of a Class is a **piece of data**.

### Encapsulation
Only the class methods should interact the fields (the data) of the object. Thus, those methods "encapsulate" all the data/attributes in the class/objects.

### Inheritance
Objects can take on properties of an existing object/class.

### Polymorphism
Accepts varied number and/or types of inputs, and perhaps changes its behavior based on these inputs.

### Abstraction 
Showing only relevant data to the user and hiding unnecessary details
